  <p> <h3>  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_" target="_blank"> Java </a>  is a programming language. <br>
    It was first developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which is now a part of Oracle Corporation. <br>
    It was released in 1995 as a part of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.  </h3> </p> <br>


 <p id="C++"> <h2> C++ </h2> </p>
<p> <h3> <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26184/c-programming-language" target="_blank"> C++ </a> is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, <br>
  developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language.<br>
   It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style". </h3> </p> <br>



  <p id="Python"> <h2> Python </h2> </p>
  <p> <h3> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_" target="_blank"> Python  </a> is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, <br>
 created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.<br>
  An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability
      (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), <br>
      and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. <br>
      The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale. </h3></p> <br>
